# 🐴 Horse - AI-Generated Image Gallery

A dynamic, responsive image gallery web application designed to showcase and record AI-generated images. This project provides a clean, Pinterest-style masonry layout that automatically organizes and displays images in an aesthetically pleasing grid format.

## 📖 About This Application

**Horse** is an automated image gallery platform specifically created to curate and display AI-generated artwork. The application serves as a visual record of images created by various AI models, providing an elegant viewing experience without requiring manual configuration.

### Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Generated Content**: All images displayed in this gallery are created by artificial intelligence models
- **🖼️ Full Image View**: Click any image to view it in full size with a convenient back button
- **🐴 Floating Icon**: Horse emoji icon on the top left that stays visible as you scroll
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapts from desktop (4 columns) to mobile (1 column) viewing
- **⚡ Automatic Image Detection**: Images are automatically discovered and added to the gallery during deployment
- **🎨 Masonry Layout**: Pinterest-style column layout that beautifully arranges images of varying sizes
- **🚀 Lazy Loading**: Images load on-demand as you scroll for optimal performance
- **✨ Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and loading transitions enhance user experience
- **🔄 Zero Configuration**: Simply add images to the folder - no manual list updates needed

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with flexbox/grid and responsive design
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages
- **Automation**: Shell script for automatic image list generation

### How It Works

1. Images are stored in the `images/` directory
2. During deployment, a shell script scans the directory for image files
3. The script automatically injects the image list into the HTML file
4. The gallery dynamically loads and displays all images in a masonry grid
5. Clicking an image opens a full-size view with navigation
6. Changes are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages

## 🖼️ Adding New Images

To add new images to the gallery:

1. Upload your image file to the `images/` folder (supports: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, webp)
2. Commit and push your changes
3. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new images and deploy the updated gallery

**That's it!** The image list is automatically generated during deployment - no manual editing required.

## 💻 Local Development

To test locally:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

The gallery will work with the current image list in `index.html`. To update the image list locally, you can run:
```bash
chmod +x .github/scripts/inject-images.sh
.github/scripts/inject-images.sh
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Runs the image injection script to update the image list
3. Uploads the site to GitHub Pages
4. Deploys to your GitHub Pages URL
