WebScrapper is a simple web application built with React that allows users to scrape the HTML content of any public web page and download the result as a text file. The app features a clean UI, dark/light mode toggle, and error handling for invalid or failed requests.

- **URL Scraping**: Enter any valid URL and fetch the HTML content using the Zenscrape API (with a demo API key).

- **Download Result**: Download the scraped HTML as a `.txt` file with a single click.

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for better accessibility.

- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap for a responsive and modern look.
