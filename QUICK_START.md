# Quick Start Guide - Automated Portfolio Sync

This guide will help you get started with the automated portfolio synchronization system in under 5 minutes.

## What You'll Get

‚úÖ Automatic portfolio updates when you create new repositories  
‚úÖ Smart content extraction from README files  
‚úÖ Intelligent code analysis for repos without README  
‚úÖ Technology stack detection  
‚úÖ Live demo links (if GitHub Pages enabled)

## Step 1: Verify Setup (1 minute)

The automation is already set up! Run this command to verify:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/test-setup.sh
```

You should see all checkmarks (‚úì).

## Step 2: Test the Sync (2 minutes)

### Option A: Manual Trigger (Recommended for first test)

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. Click **"Sync Projects from Repositories"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
5. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button
6. Wait 1-2 minutes and check the results

### Option B: Command Line Trigger

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh workflow run sync-projects.yml

# Check status
gh run list --workflow=sync-projects.yml
```

## Step 3: Create a Test Repository (2 minutes)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., "test-project")
2. Add a description or homepage URL in the **About** section
3. Add a README.md with some content (optional but recommended)
4. Wait for the next scheduled sync (runs every 6 hours) OR trigger manually

Example README.md:
```markdown
# Test Project

This is a test project to verify the portfolio automation.

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

Built with JavaScript and React.
```

## What Happens Next?

### Automatic Process

1. **Discovery**: The workflow finds your new repository
2. **Check**: Verifies it has a homepage/description and is public
3. **Fetch**: Gets README.md content or analyzes code
4. **Generate**: Creates a markdown file in `_projects/`
5. **Deploy**: Commits and pushes to trigger GitHub Pages rebuild
6. **Live**: Your portfolio updates with the new project!

### Timeline

- **Scheduled**: Every 6 hours automatically
- **Manual**: Instant when you trigger the workflow
- **Webhook**: Instant if configured (see Advanced Setup)

## Viewing Your Projects

Once synced, projects appear at:
- **Portfolio**: https://pappater.github.io/portfolio/
- **Project File**: `_projects/your-repo-name.md`

## Expected Output

Your new project file will look like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Test Project"
date: 2025-01-15
layout: project
tech: "JavaScript, React"
---

This is a test project to verify the portfolio automation.

Features:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

Built with JavaScript and React.

Source: [github.com/pappater/test-project](https://github.com/pappater/test-project)

Live: [https://pappater.github.io/test-project/](https://pappater.github.io/test-project/)
```

## Customizing Projects

After a project is synced, you can manually edit it:

1. Find the file in `_projects/your-repo-name.md`
2. Edit the frontmatter or content
3. Commit and push
4. Your custom changes will be preserved

To regenerate from source:
1. Delete the `.md` file
2. Trigger the sync workflow
3. The project will be recreated fresh

## Troubleshooting

### Project didn't sync?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Repository is public (not private)
- [ ] Repository has a description or homepage URL
- [ ] Repository is not archived
- [ ] You've triggered the workflow or waited for schedule

### How to check?

```bash
# Check if project file exists
ls -la _projects/your-repo-name.md

# View workflow logs
# Go to Actions tab ‚Üí Click on workflow run ‚Üí View logs
```

### Still not working?

1. Check the Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has correct permissions
3. See [WEBHOOK_SETUP.md](WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) for detailed troubleshooting

## Advanced Features

### Enable AI Descriptions (Optional)

1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add secret: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key
4. Next sync will use AI to enhance descriptions

### Instant Updates via Webhook

See [WEBHOOK_SETUP.md](WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) for setting up instant notifications.

### Add to Other Repos

Want other repos to notify your portfolio instantly?

Copy `.github/workflows/EXAMPLE_REPO_WORKFLOW.yml` to your project repositories.
