# Portfolio Enhancements - October 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the major enhancements made to the portfolio site to improve automation, user experience, and design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Full README Content Integration ✅
**File Modified**: `.github/scripts/sync-projects.js`

**Change**: The sync script now uses the **entire README.md content** instead of truncating it.

**Before**:
```javascript
// Extract first meaningful section from README
const cleanReadme = readme
  .replace(/^#.*$/gm, '') // Remove headers
  .replace(/```[\s\S]*?```/g, '') // Remove code blocks
  .slice(0, 5) // Only 5 lines
  .join('\n\n');
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Use the entire README content without truncation
if (readme) {
  content += readme + '\n\n';
}
```

**Impact**: Project pages now display complete documentation from the repository's README, providing comprehensive information to visitors.

### 2. Removed Header Section ✅
**File Modified**: `index.html`

**Change**: Removed any header navigation or information links. The page now starts directly with the project title and grid.

**Impact**: Cleaner, more focused landing page that puts projects front and center.

### 3. Footer with "How it Works" Modal ✅
**File Modified**: `index.html`

**New Features**:
- Clean footer at the bottom of the page
- "How it Works" link that opens an informative modal

- Smooth animations and keyboard support (ESC to close)
